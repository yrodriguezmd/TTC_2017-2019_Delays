# TTC_2017-2019_Delays

Datasets were uploaded from the City of Toronto's open data portal.

Questions targeted include:
1) Were there patterns of delay in relation to time (year, month, day of week, hour)?
2) Were there specific lines and stations that caused the most frequent and prolonged delays?
3) What were the most common causes of delay?

Data from separate datasets were merged into one.  There were 10 attributes and 58844 entries with some missing values.  Attributes included both continuous and categorical data.  

Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses were done, with emphasis on Time-Series procedures.

Autocorrelations were determined.  Linear regression was computed and plotted for delay frequency and duration.
